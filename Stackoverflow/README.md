## Data Analysis of Stack Overflow's Most Popular Programming Languages
This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing data on the most popular programming languages on Stack Overflow. The analysis is based on data from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey and uses Python's powerful data analysis libraries.

Libraries Used
1. Pandas
Purpose: Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis, allowing you to handle structured data such as CSV files.
Documentation: Pandas Documentation
Key Functions:
read_csv(): Load data from a CSV file.
DataFrame.head(): Display the first few rows of a DataFrame.
DataFrame.groupby(): Group data based on specific columns.
DataFrame.describe(): Generate descriptive statistics.
2. Matplotlib
Purpose: Matplotlib is a versatile plotting library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
Documentation: Matplotlib Documentation
Key Functions:
pyplot.plot(): Generate line plots.
pyplot.bar(): Create bar charts to compare language popularity.
pyplot.title(), pyplot.xlabel(), pyplot.ylabel(): Add titles and labels to your plots.
3. Seaborn
Purpose: Seaborn builds on Matplotlib and simplifies the creation of complex statistical plots.
Documentation: Seaborn Documentation
Key Functions:
seaborn.barplot(): Create bar plots with added statistical analysis.
seaborn.heatmap(): Visualize correlations between variables, such as language usage over time.
seaborn.boxplot(): Visualize the distribution of data points.
Data Sources
The analysis is based on the Stack Overflow Developer Survey, which provides insights into programming languages, tools, and technologies used by developers worldwide.
