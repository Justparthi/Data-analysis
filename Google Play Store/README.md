# Data Analysis of Google Play Store Apps

This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing data related to apps on the Google Play Store. The analysis is based on publicly available data and uses Python's powerful data analysis libraries.


### Running the Analysis

You can run the analysis using Python locally or via a Jupyter notebook. Alternatively, you can try out the code directly in a Google Colab notebook:

- **Google Colab Notebook**: [Interactive Analysis Example](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Wl8LEh6x4J9vjln4T9Y8n2gA027xms9o#scrollTo=W1iVoT8Dos7x)

### Libraries Used

#### 1. Pandas
- **Purpose**: Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis, allowing you to handle structured data such as CSV files.
- **Documentation**: [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)
- **Key Functions**:
  - `read_csv()`: Load data from a CSV file.
  - `DataFrame.head()`: Display the first few rows of a DataFrame.
  - `DataFrame.groupby()`: Group data based on specific columns, such as app category or ratings.
  - `DataFrame.describe()`: Generate descriptive statistics on app data (e.g., ratings, downloads).

#### 2. Matplotlib
- **Purpose**: Matplotlib is a versatile plotting library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Documentation**: [Matplotlib Documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html)
- **Key Functions**:
  - `pyplot.plot()`: Generate line plots to show trends over time, such as app downloads.
  - `pyplot.bar()`: Create bar charts to compare app categories or ratings.
  - `pyplot.title()`, `pyplot.xlabel()`, `pyplot.ylabel()`: Add titles and labels to your plots.

#### 3. Seaborn
- **Purpose**: Seaborn builds on Matplotlib and simplifies the creation of complex statistical plots.
- **Documentation**: [Seaborn Documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- **Key Functions**:
  - `seaborn.barplot()`: Create bar plots to analyze app categories or ratings distribution.
  - `seaborn.heatmap()`: Visualize correlations between variables, such as ratings and downloads.
  - `seaborn.boxplot()`: Visualize the distribution of app ratings or downloads.

### Data Sources

The analysis is based on data related to Google Play Store apps, which can be sourced from various app data platforms or datasets.
