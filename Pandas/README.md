# Data Analysis of Salaries by College Major

This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing data on salaries by college major. The analysis is based on publicly available data and uses Python's powerful data analysis libraries.

### Libraries Used

#### 1. Pandas
- **Purpose**: Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis, allowing you to handle structured data such as CSV files.
- **Documentation**: [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)
- **Key Functions**:
  - `read_csv()`: Load data from a CSV file.
  - `DataFrame.head()`: Display the first few rows of a DataFrame.
  - `DataFrame.groupby()`: Group data based on specific columns, such as major.
  - `DataFrame.describe()`: Generate descriptive statistics on salary data.

#### 2. Matplotlib
- **Purpose**: Matplotlib is a versatile plotting library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Documentation**: [Matplotlib Documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html)
- **Key Functions**:
  - `pyplot.plot()`: Generate line plots to show salary trends.
  - `pyplot.bar()`: Create bar charts to compare salaries across different majors.
  - `pyplot.title()`, `pyplot.xlabel()`, `pyplot.ylabel()`: Add titles and labels to your plots.

#### 3. Seaborn
- **Purpose**: Seaborn builds on Matplotlib and simplifies the creation of complex statistical plots.
- **Documentation**: [Seaborn Documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- **Key Functions**:
  - `seaborn.barplot()`: Create bar plots to analyze average salaries by major.
  - `seaborn.heatmap()`: Visualize correlations between majors and salary ranges.
  - `seaborn.boxplot()`: Visualize the distribution of salaries across different majors.
